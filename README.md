## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to perform real-time gender detection using a pre-trained CNN model. The model classifies faces detected in video frames as either 'Male' or 'Female'.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gender-detection-cnn.git
